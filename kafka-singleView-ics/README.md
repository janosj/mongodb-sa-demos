# Kafka Integration: 2 Demos

These demos have Kafka in common, so they have been collocated here to reuse the kafka installation script, as well as to provide options if the intent is to demonstrate kafka integration.

* Demo 1: Self-Service Data Access (a.k.a. Single View), based on COVID data reporting
* Demo 2: ICS (Integrated Cockpit Sensors), a time series and IoT scenario

Single View demonstrates the utility of the JSON data model when bringing in non-uniform data from disparate systems (using Kafka).

ICS demonstrates the ability to bring in sensor data using Kafka, along with some data modeling techniques that you can apply to time series data. 

Additional documentation for each demo can be found in their respective directories within the "run" folder.
