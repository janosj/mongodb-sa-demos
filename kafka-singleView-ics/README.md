# Kafka Integration - Single View - Sensors

These demos have Kafka in common, so they have been collocated here to reuse the kafka installation scripts, as well as to provide options if the intent is to demonstrate kafka integration.

* Demo 1: Single View
* Demo 2: ICS (Integrated Cockpit Sensors)

Single View demonstrates the utility of the JSON data model when bringing in data from disparate systems (using Kafka).

ICS demonstrates the ability to bring in sensor data using Kafka, and then some data modeling techniques that you can apply to time series data. 

Additional documentation for each demo can be found in their respective directories within the "run" folder.
